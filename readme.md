<h1>How Airbnb Affects Long-Term Rental Supply in San Francisco</h1>
  
San Francisco is in a housing crisis, and some critics blame short term rentals on Airbnb for taking away already scarce housing from long_term rentals.

For this project, we explore Airbnb's impact on the long-term rental supply using Inside Airbnb's dataset.  Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that helped us explore how Airbnb is being used. They regularly scrape publicly available information about Airbnb's listings.
