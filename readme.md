<h1>How Airbnb Affects Long-Term Rental Supply in San Francisco</h1>
  
<h2>Goal</h2>
San Francisco is in a housing crisis. The city's limited housing supply and unaffordable rents are squeezing out local residents. Some critics blame short-term rentals on Airbnb for taking away already scarce housing from long-term rentals.

Our goal with this project is to understand the following:

1.  Quantify Airbnb's effect on San Francisco's long-term rental supply
2.  Understand how Airbnb is being used in all San Francisco neighborhoods (because real estate is local)
3.  Identify and quantify illegally listed units in San Francisco (because illegal units may displace local residents)

For this project, we explore Airbnb's impact on the long-term rental supply using Inside Airbnb's dataset.  Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that helped us explore how Airbnb is being used. They regularly scrape publicly available information about Airbnb's listings.
