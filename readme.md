<h1>How Airbnb Affects Long-Term Rental Supply in San Francisco</h1>
  
San Francisco is in a housing crisis. The city's limited housing supply and unaffordable rents are squeezing out local residents. Some critics blame short-term rentals on Airbnb for taking away already scarce housing from long-term rentals.

Our goal with this project is to understand the following:

1.  Quantify Airbnb's effect on San Francisco's long-term rental supply
2.  Understand how Airbnb is being used in all San Francisco neighborhoods (because real estate is local)
3.  Identify and quantify illegally listed units in San Francisco (because illegal units may displace local residents)

<h2>The Data</h2>
We explored Airbnb's impact on the long-term rental supply using data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">Inside Airbnb's dataset</a>.  Inside Airbnb is an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that helped us explore how Airbnb is being used. They regularly scrape publicly available information about Airbnb's listings.

We used the following features for our analysis:
1.  Room Type:  An air bnb can list an entire home/apartment, private room or shared room.  We consider listings under the entire home/apartment cateogry as dwelling units that can be added to the long-term rental stock.
2.  Room Type by neighborhood:  Real estate is local, and so are Airbnb listings.  We wanted to understand how Room Type changes by neighborhood.
